We present the largest multi-omics study of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and quantitative blood lipid and lipoprotein traits, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG), conducted to date in Hispanic/Latino populations (n<sub>max</sub>=63,185). 

This repository presents newly trained in silico models of gene expression in pancreatic islet cells.
